# This file contains all the input Binary Neural Network (BNN)
# test cases that were used in the paper to evaluate compressor
# tree synthesis on different proposed FPGA architectures (and
# also baselines).

# BNNs (primary compression stage + 2-column popcounting)
#
# A primary compression stage is required that creates a
# 2-column popcount of sums and carries. The cost of this stage
# is added as a comment for each test case.
