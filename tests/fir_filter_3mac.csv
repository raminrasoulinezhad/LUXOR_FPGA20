# This file contains all the input FIR filter and 3-MAC
# operation test cases that were used in the paper to evaluate
# compressor tree synthesis on different proposed FPGA
# architectures (and also baselines).

# FIR filter and 3-MAC operations
#
# FIR-filter source: Parandeh-Afshar et. al. [18]
#
# e.g. 3-MAC operation: AB + CD + EF, where A-F are signed N-bit
# inputs. Each 'dot' in the dot notation for each of the operations
# in this set requires a primary compression stage, where a logical
# AND is computed using input bits from numbers A-F. The cost of
# this primary compression stage can be statically-determined
# for 3-MAC, and is listed as a comment for each test case.
